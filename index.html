            <p>
                I am creating the tech of the future including infinite electricity, advanced 3d scanning technology, and voice replication artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Infinite electricity</h3>
            <p>Imagine all the possibilities with infinite electricity. No more polution and climate change. No more having to spend money on gas. No more electric bills. This technology can fix the world in many ways. Everyone could have electricity. While this tech is still being prototyped, it has a very promisable future. Below is a diagram of the first prototype.</p>


            <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Infinite universe theory</h3>
            <p>If I told you that you were a universe, you would most likely tell me how humans are nothing like planets. But if you think about it, what really is a universe? Here is the definition of "universe" from Google Dictionary: "all existing matter and space considered as a whole". Wait... humans are made out of matter also!? You see, humans and all other forms of matter can be considered universes. Even cells. Think about all matter as boxes. You place the matter box inside of a box, and then place that box inside of another box. You do this an infinite amount of times. This is the same as all matter. There are cells inside of humans, humans inside of the planet, planets insite of the galaxy, and galaxies inside of the universe. In my theory, I call the current universe that you are on the protoverse. The protoverse changes depending on what universe you are on or talking about. Microuniverses are universes smaller than the protoverse. Macrouniverses are the opposite of microuniverses; greater than the protoverse. Your brain is probably fried by now. Below is a diagram to help you better understand this theory.</p>
